# 🚀 GPU-Based Image Segmentation using U-Net (PyTorch + Colab + CUDA)

## ✅ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to train a U-Net deep learning model for image segmentation using **GPU acceleration**.  
The model is trained using **PyTorch with CUDA** on Google Colab.  
The goal is to show understanding of GPU-based training and deployment of AI models, as required in the **Coursera GPU Specialization Capstone Project**.

✅ Uses **GPU-enabled training (CUDA)**  
✅ Runs in **Google Colab** or any machine with NVIDIA GPU  
✅ Works even with **unlabeled images** (auto-generated masks)  
✅ Includes **training script, inference script, model saving, plots, sample outputs**
